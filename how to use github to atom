How to use github!!

If your contributor:
    fork it first!!

First things first:
    terminal:  git clone https://github.com/myusername/myrepository.git
    # The folder with the name of the repository will be added to the files!!

Second things second:
    add/put all the files that you want to add/put to the repository!

Third things third:
    terminal:  git add .
    # You can also stage all unsaved changes to the github with Atom

Fourth thi... Ok, I'll stop.

terminal:  git commit -am "message"
# You can just use "git commit" but it will hace no message.
# You could also use Atom

terminal: git push
# It will be pushed to the repository in github. YAY!

You've done it!!!
But that's not it...
You can also fetch and pull data from other contributors updating the data!

terminal:  git fetch
terminal:  git pull

if your a contributor, not the creator, then you have to pull request like in
this pull.png!
then click new pull request!
it should automaticly compare the forked version from you with the old version
that the creator has!!
if not then choose it manually!!
don't be stupid... you should remember by now!

and the creator will consider merging it or not!!
creators choice...

That is it!! i guess...
